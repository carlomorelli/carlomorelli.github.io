= Generating Docker artifacts in your Java project

:hp-tags: Java, Docker, Maven

I have been working for 6 months in a new project in my company. It is quite exciting, we do a lot of cutting-edge technology and of course we use massively Jenkins for continous integration.

One of the problems that we started facing at one point is *what* to deliver. We were used to publish our WAR artifact to Artifactory, where it layed there to gain dust. Then our integration-test framework would run immediately after the build (triggered by mvn integration-test), and instead of retrieving the artifact, would use a new build run to generate the WAR in the target/ dir.

The test framework targets Amazon Web Services and from day1 we decided to have everything dockerized. So our app (which runs in a Jetty base image) together with some services (dockerized Apache Kafka and Zookeeper, dockerized Postgres service) build, retrieve a We have a lot of tools at our avaiablity (Artifactory in primis) but we are not able to make them work efficently.

So I took myself the task to improve our workflow, thanks also to our DevOps specialist who explained me a lot of nuts'n'bolts of Docker.

<plugin>
  <groupId>com.spotify</groupId>
  <artifactId>docker-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>0.4.13</version>
  <configuration>

      <imageTag>${project.version}-${myimage.build}</imageTag>
    </imageTags>

    <registryUrl>https://artifactory.mycompany.net</registryUrl>
  </configuration>

Notice that the *server_entry* is the label of an entry that you have to insert into ~/.m2/settings.xml as such:

[source, xml]
-------------------
<server>
  <id>server_entry</id>
  <username>insert_login_name_here</username>
  <password>insert_password_here</password>
  <configuration>
    <email>insert_your_email_here</email>
  </configuration>
</server>
-------------------

Strangely enough the email field is *mandatory* for the current version of the spotify Docker-maven-plugin to work correctly, so watch out!
