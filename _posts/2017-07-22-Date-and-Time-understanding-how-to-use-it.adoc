= Date and Time: understanding how to use it

:hp-tags: Java

Nothing gets th heat up among programmers like the good old debate on Date and Time. Just a few days ago I was discussing with a collague about a Date usage in an integration testcase that we were preparing. Date and Time are like the regular expression problem, at least for me: I understand of it work but cannot for the life of me memorize the rules of a regex, so 90% of times I have to google some stuff.

This triggered me to make a little summary because a lots of things are not obvious, especially in Java where we have basically 3 official implementations from the JDK, and 1 semi-official from project JodaTime.
